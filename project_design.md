1. This is a project that is made to track my docker learning journey
2. I need to document each command and its result to be logged into the command log and it is to be logged in such a way that additional comments need to be added to each instance of log when and where it is required
Make sure the log file is updated after every command run.
I will be making use of the chat window terminal so that chat could get access to the response as well
